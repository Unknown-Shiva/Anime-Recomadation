              <h3>Death Note</h3>
              <br />

              <p>
                Imagine finding a notebook that lets you kill anyone just by
                writing their name — scary, right? That’s what happens to Light
                Yagami, a genius student who decides to use it to “cleanse” the
                world of criminals. But his plan attracts the attention of L, a
                brilliant detective determined to stop him.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                It’s a psychological thriller, mystery, and supernatural anime
                filled with mind games, tension, and moral questions. Every
                episode feels like a chess match between two geniuses. If you
                love clever plots, dark themes, and thrilling twists, Death Note
                is an absolute must-watch classic.

              <br />

              <p>
                Gabimaru, a deadly ninja sentenced to death, is offered freedom
                if he finds the Elixir of Life on a mysterious island filled
                with monsters and killers. Alongside the executioner Sagiri, he
                faces twisted creatures and his own past.

                It’s a dark fantasy, action, and psychological anime mixing
                brutal fights with emotional depth. The world is eerie yet
                beautiful, blending horror, philosophy, and redemption. The
                animation is top-tier, and the story questions what it means to
                live. If you liked Jujutsu Kaisen or Chainsaw Man, you’ll love

              <br />

              <p>
                Imagine stepping into an ancient palace full of secrets, perfumes, and poisons. That’s where Maomao, a clever young apothecary, finds herself after being forced to work as a servant. She’s curious, sharp-tongued, and can’t resist solving mysteries — especially when they involve strange illnesses or suspicious deaths.
